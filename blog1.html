    <p class="blogs-container">There is no doubt to say that these days online education is becoming more popular among students. 
        The quality of education has improved through online education. Students can easily refer to the content at their time and convenience. 
        Nowadays, colleges and universities are providing online higher education degrees. 
        This is the great news that now you can get a higher degree education or academics at your fingertips without affecting your daily life activities.
        Almost everyone prefers to learn online that has created a demand for more online collages and institutes.
    </p>

    <p class="blogs-container">
        Online education has brought a positive impact on the lives of students and working professionals. 
        It has given them an opportunity to take up additional courses along with their studies or job at their convenience.
        Online education work as a lifeline to those people who face physical disabilities and geographical distances. In the era of digitalisation, the scope of online classes has increased even more.
        Online education have also helped the faculty in the institutions to ask students to refer/study some parts of the syllabus online, which do not require much classroom teaching. 
        Thus, faculty can save time and utilise it to interact with the students more.
    </p>

    <h1 class="blogs-step">Involvement of Technologies in Online Education</h1>

    <p class="blogs-container">
        New technologies provide educators with a bigger variety of teaching methods and materials. Some of these new technologies include mobile educational apps, collaborative platforms, learning analytics, virtual reality, and many other innovative tools and approaches.
        Â These new educational materials and methods can help make the learning process much more appealing and engaging for both students and teachers.
    </p>

    <p class="blogs-container">
        As technology changes and influences education, the role of the teacher also changes. The focus becomes less on being a subject expert but rather on a guide in navigating all of the available information and technology. 
        Technology in education is more than following trends; instead, it is a powerful tool that can enrich and improve the education process for both teacher and student.
    </p>

    <p class="blogs-container">
        The major switch to online education was seen during pandemic as millions of students lost access to in-person instruction.Covid-19 brought out a drastic change in the educational system not only in India but rather in the entire world. 
        Universities across India as well as around the globe moved to the virtual classes suspending physical classrooms.
    </p>
    

    <h1 class="blogs-step">Online vs Offline Education</h1>

    <p class="blogs-container">Online learning is cost-effectiveness as it is less expensive than traditional learning. Transportation costs are just one of the numerous cost associated with the existing educational system.
        Students require appropriate uniforms as well as a number of other items. In an online classes, students are allowed to select the subjects they want to learn about.
        They can view it multiple times for better comprehension. Students have no options in offline schooling. 
    </p>

    <p class="blogs-container">
        Online learning presents new challenges for students, but it also have potential to cut them off from their surroundings. Children's physical and mental development are both aided by attending school.
        They enjoy spending time with their friends and teacher.
    </p>

    <p class="blogs-container">
        Thus, online education is productive but it has some limitations which will solve in future I believe.
